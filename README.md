# BetterPhotosApp Project

### Author: Debjit M.

This project is about my take on complex css layouts for **_Modern Web Development_** in **_2022_**, built on `Sass` and compiled with `Webpack`.

BetterPhotosApp is a `Professional Landing Page` which heavily focuses on Flexbox and CSS Grid with proper semantic HTML and BEM classnames for it's style.

I have used **_Webpack_** as a Module Bundler to compile the **_Sass_** and dynamic injection into the DOM, and also included **_Babel_** to make the Website compatible for older Browsers.

**_Note_** - This project only focuses on the `Html` && `SCSS` and building the Skeleton and making it look good as well as _Responsive_. It doesn't have any functionality, and I plan to keep it that way.

> I have used my Webpack 5 Module Bundler BoilerPlate to start the project, you can check it out for your projects as well at **[Webpack5 Renovated](https://github.com/sunnydebjit/Webpack5)**.

Included npm packages -

1. **Webpack**- _webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, webpack-bundle-analyzer_
2. **Babel** - _@babel/core, @babel/preset-env, babel-loader_
3. **Styles** - _sass, sass-loader, css-loader, style-loader_
4. **Images/Resource** - *Asset/Resource Loader, *html-webpack-plugin\*

After cloning this repo make you install the packages with `npm install` on your bash|powershell terminal.

> Use these **_quick commands_** for your _build/dev_ work-
> To fine tune check the `webpack.config.js` , `package.json`

1. To start a **development server** with live/hot reloading run `npm run start`
2. To build your code for **production** run `npm run build`
3. To **visualize** _bundle size_ run `npm run stats`

_Feel free to play with this project to look under the hood how things work._
I will keep this `Readme` updated in case some dependency has a change, _apologies_ in advance for any errors.
